Soapmaking the Natural Way: 45 Melt-and-Pour Recipes Using Herbs, Flowers & Essential Oils by Rebecca Ittner Book Review

Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: .0 out of 5 stars Pictures are deceiving, but the soap is still nice.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2011
Review: I purchased this book because I wanted some nice and easy melt-and-pour recipes. With lots of little ones underfoot, I don't want to mess around with lye. I'd never be able to get anything made!

So far, I've made two of the recipes in the book: the brown sugar and vanilla soap and the lavender soap. The instructions were easy to follow and the soaps smelled wonderful and worked well. However, neither looked anything like the pictures in the book.

For the brown sugar and vanilla soap, the picture shows a bar that looks similar in color to a Neutrogena bar. When I added the specified amount of vanilla essential oil, the mixture turned almost black. Still pretty, but not what I expected. The second time I made it, I just added a few drops of vanilla EO to darken the soap slightly and add fragrance.

The lavender soap only lists three ingredients: olive oil suspension base, dried lavender flowers, and lavender essential oil. Yet the soap pictured is a deep, translucent purple. Not having any experience in soapmaking, I assumed that either the essential oil or the lavender flowers would provide the colorant. Of course, neither did. The lavender EO is clear and the flowers, while beautiful and fragrant, did not leach any type of color into the mixture. I basically wound up with a clear bar dotted with small flower heads. Still pretty, but again, not what I expected.

Review: I use this as a reference, I haven't made every soap recipe that is in here but the few that I have tried are absolutely gorgeous I love it and I've shared my products with my family and friends and they agree as well. It is great for beginners, they are simple easy to follow soap recipes, I have nothing to complain about only positive experiences with it. I highly recommend it to others who are curious to try and make homemade soaps. I've seen some videos on soap making but for some reason my never come out smelling like they say in the videos and some don't have that aesthetic aspect to them. This book helps me get inspired to make mine look as nice as they smell.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Inconsistent Results, but Great Ideas to Perfect
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2011
Review: "Soapmaking: The Natural Way" by Rebecca Ittner may just be a good book about the melt and pour process of making soap with a misleading title. Instead of cosmetic fragrances and dyes to scent and color her creations, Ittner promotes the use of essential oils, natural spices and colorants to perk up and craft a variety of attractive soaps that facilitate vendor-purchased soap as a base. "Melt and Pour Soapmaking: Using Natural Colorants and Fragrance" might correlate title with contents to give the expectant crafter a more realistic heads up.

If you enjoy crafting melt and pour soaps--many cold-process soapmakers consider melt and pour to be somewhat cheating when it comes to the art of actually cooking up soap with lye--Ittner's book will give you plenty of ideas from which to expand your soaping repertoire without having to create an entire loaf of soap just to get some distinguishing features into your final design. The beginning pages explain and detail the different bases, the various additives (milks, butters, oils, colorants, botanicals and clays) as well as her recommendations for some basic scents blended with essential oil with rudimentary comments on the perfumer's art of crafting a fragrance consisting of top, middle and base notes. In addition, she details the process of the actual soap molding with thoughts on the various techniques the will add uniqueness to each bar.

Ittner follows these introductory comments with 45 recipes that will allow the crafter with some practice to create a lovely bar of soap. However, what looks good and what works as a soap in terms of lather are two very different things. Melt and pour soapcrafters know from experience that the more extra items you put into your "melt" the less the bar is actually going to behave like soap. Unfortunately, I found that to be the case with this book. The recipes did not consistently produce a bar of soap that was going to actually lather up and clean the user.

Ittner's ideas on natural colorants while interesting and appealing to the crafter who takes pride in using non-chemical ingredients, do not produce the results so clearly depicted in the glossy pages of the book. Case in point, the recipe for "Bamboo Garden" an attractive sea glass green colored concoction that uses kelp powder and turmeric powder to provide the delicate shade of aquamarine produced something a bit darker and far less appealing when I crafted it. Obviously, practice makes perfect. However when using expensive essential oils and other safe-for-skin ingredients, multiple and inconsistent trial runs can quickly bleed out one's wallet.

Bottom line? "Soapmaking: The Natural Way" contains some great ideas for the melt and pour soapcrafter to try and perfect. Due to the inconsistent nature of the results, this reviewer recommends this book as one in an arsenal of tools that will help the crafter perfect their own technique. I would not rely on this book's recipes to create soaps for a marketplace without testing them out multiple times, taking notes on what various additives do to the overall results in terms of color and lathering ability. The author's idea of using only essential oils in her soap is not only expensive but imparts a medicinal scent to her product which is not always the desired result. In terms of technique, Ittner details some ideas, but her comments on swirling two colors together have not helped me to create just the effect that I would like to get within one bar. Any comments or suggestions regarding this are welcome--melt and pour suggestions only! Recommended, nonetheless for its multitude of ideas and combinations.

Review: This is a really great melt and pour book. Some of the other reviewers gave low scores based on the fact that this is not a cp soap book - thus is not 'all natural'. It clearly states on the front of this book that it is - in fact - a book of melt and pour recipes. These people should not have been surprised. This book has interesting scent combinations and colors - which is exactly what I was looking for! There are excellent photos for each soap recipe, so you can see exactly what you will be making. I am excited to try some of these soaps and encourage folks to READ the clearly shown cover and description of the book before purchasing (and then complaining).

Review: I have used quite a few soap recipes from this book. The recipes are easy to follow, smell great, and the recipe for men's shaving soap is real nice when my husband shaves. The clay in the soap helps with razor burn and his skin looks soft when he is finished. Also, the lavender soaps are nice in the shower. I have this book posted on my Squidoo pages as a recommended product - I have tried the recipes so I know this is a good offer. Marie Browning has good recipes also.
